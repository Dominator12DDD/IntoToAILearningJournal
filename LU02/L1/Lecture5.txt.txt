Generative AI - Text

Prompt Engineering - How can I get the AI to do what I want with the most efficient/shortest input.

Prompt - natural language text that requests the generative AI to perform a specific task.

Prompt Pros:
- Improved user experience
- Improved Flexibility
- Cost Efficient

Prompt Steps:

Task:
Persona(Who the AI is)
Format - Output type

Context:
Good - Give me some ideas for a birthday present. Under $30.
Great - Give me 5 ideas for a birthday present. My budget is $30. The gift is for a 29 year old who loves winter sports. And has recently switched to snowboarding from skiing.

Reference: 
Additional Input data, ideas

Evalute
Is it a good present? Is it under $30? Does it meet the requirements?

Iterate
Go through errors and have changes/fixes with AI (Loops back around to Task)

Break down prompts to get better outputs.
AI can get stuck in a rut/ a loop. Start a new conversation or reword the task.
Adding constraints creates more tailored outputs.
