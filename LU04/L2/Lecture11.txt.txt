Unit 4 Lecture 2: Cookie Clicker

Worked with AI to generate a cookie clicker AI slop game.
We started with assets and asked it to generate the game. 
We then asked it to add a auto clicker system with a grandma feature
that increased the auto clicker with each one bought. Then finally we
added an achievements system with bars for progress.
