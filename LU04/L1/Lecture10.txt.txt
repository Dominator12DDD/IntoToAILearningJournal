Unit 4 Lecture 1 - Vibe Coding

Vibe coding is where you kind of go with the flow
and just type stuff out. It isn't structured or
aiming for anything. Sometimes it isn't really
code more just experimenting to just see what
happens. People vibe code then pay others to actually
code what they wrote or to fix mistakes.
