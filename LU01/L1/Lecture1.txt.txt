What is AI?
Refers to computer systems that can perform complex tasks (reasoning, decision making, creating, etc)
There is no single, simple definition of artificial intelligence. If it can interpret data, learn, and adapt then it can be considered AI. We don't refer to machines/AI as robots(Ex: Washing machine, dish washer). Lots of new machines are being called AI, older things aren't considered AI. Our definitions of AI constantly change. AI maybe becoming a "bubble"
