Unit 1 Lecture 2 - AI Terms

Algorithm: A set of rules that a machine can follow to learn how to do a task. Unlike AI, it can be determined.

Bias: Assumptions made by a model that simplify the process of learning to do its assigned task. The creators behind AI can be biased, making it also biased.

Big Data: Datasets that are too large or complex to be used by traditional data processing applications.

Black Box: A system whose internal workings are opaque, making it not very transparent or hard for people to understand

Context Window: is the maximum number of tokens an AI can process and consider when generating a response.

Generative AI: is an advanced technological approach that enables the creation of content including, text, images, and videos

Hallucination: when AI is making something up. Inaccurate or illogical responses.

Large Language Model (LLM): neural networks are known as LLM, they work by forecasting word sequences.

Meta Prompt/System Prompt: The set of instructions given to the AI behind the scenes before an interaction begins

Prompt Engineering: the practice of designing effective prompts to guide an Ai model's output.

Temperature (AI Temperature): temperature settings controls how deterministic or creative an Ai model's output is.

Token: Common sequences of characters found in a set of text, 4 characters per token. (used to have more on older models, less now to save money)
